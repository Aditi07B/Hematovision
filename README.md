# ü©∏ Hematovision

**Hematovision** is an AI-powered Flask web app that classifies microscopic blood cell images based on the type of **white blood cells (WBCs)** detected. This tool can support early detection of certain blood conditions ‚Äî though it's not for professional use (yet) due to current model accuracy.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The current model is a basic CNN and does not replace medical diagnosis. Improvements are on the roadmap.
